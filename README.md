<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Axel! 👋🏻</h1>

<p align="justify">
🎓 I'm a third-year Software Engineering student with a minor in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Calgary. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
👨🏼‍💻 In summer 2023, I interned at Sigma as a Software Engineer, where I contributed to a B2B Foodservice Ecommerce Platform. This experience deepened my skills in Spring Boot, SQL, CI/CD, and End-to-end testing, and introduced me to SAP and Azure DevOps.

🦖 Currently, I'm Co-VP Development for the Student Energy University of Calgary Chapter. I maintain our official website, interview junior developer candidates, and have consulted with the Faculty of Science on potential new academic programs.
</p>

📱 Since September 2022, I've been a Software Developer with TechStart UCalgary. I worked with Bandist on a music notification app and later joined Fashion as a Backend Developer, creating an app that educates users about eco-friendly clothing choices.
