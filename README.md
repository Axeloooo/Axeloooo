<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Axel! 👋🏻</h1>

<p align="justify">
🎓 I'm a third-year Software Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Calgary.

👨🏼‍💻 During summer 2023 I had the privilege of intering at Sigma as a Software Engineer, where I contributed to the development and maintenance of a Foodservice B2B Ecommerce Platform. My internship at Sigma allowed me to learn the basics of SAP and Azure DevOps as well as improve my knowledge in software architecture and distribution. I honed my expertise in Spring Boot, SQL databases, CI/CD technologies and End-to-end testing.

🦖 I currently hold the position of Co-VP Development for the Student Energy University of Calgary Chapter, where I contribute to the development and maintenance of the official website. In addition to this, I conduct interviews for prospective candidates for the junior development positions. Alongside the Chapter’s members, we've also provided consulting to the Faculty of Science at the University of Calgary, offering insights into potential new majors and minors.

📱 Additionally, I've been involved with TechStart UCalgary as a Software Developer since September 2022. During this time, I collaborated with two teams on the development of mobile apps. First, I teamed up with Bandist in the role of a Full-Stack Developer, working on a cross-platform application. Then, I moved with Fashion as a Backend/Algorithm Developer, developing a fashion education and consumption application.
